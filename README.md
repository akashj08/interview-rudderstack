### Overview

This project provides a system to manage alerts programmatically with defined actions. It receives alerts via a webhook, enriches the alert data by fetching additional information from services like Prometheus, and takes appropriate actions such as sending notifications to Slack.

### Architecture

1. **Receive:**
   - A webhook endpoint is set up to receive alerts.
  
2. **Enrich:**
   - Enriches the received alerts with additional data, such as CPU/memory utilization fetched from Prometheus or other monitoring tools.
  
3. **Take Action:**
   - Based on the enriched data, appropriate actions are taken. These could include:
     - Sending a notification to Slack.
     - Forwarding the alert to PagerDuty.
     - Automatic remediation actions (e.g., scaling resources).

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

- **Docker** installed
- **Kubernetes Cluster** (e.g., kind, Minikube, EKS , GKE etc.)
- **kubectl** and **helm** installed
- **Prometheus** and **Alertmanager** deployed in the cluster

#### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/alert-manager.git
   cd alert-manager
   ```
   Update the app.py as per you requirement . Just build the docker imager
3. **Build the Docker Image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/alert-manager:v1 .
   ```

4. **Push the Docker Image:**

   ```bash
   docker push your-dockerhub-username/alert-manager:v1
   ```

5. **Deploy Prometheus:**

   - Deploy Prometheus using the provided Helm chart inside the `helm-chart/` folder:

     ```bash
     kubectl create  ns monitor
     helm install prometheus helm-chart/prometheus/  -n monitor
     ```

6. **Update Kubernetes Manifest:**

   - **Slack Webhook URL:** Ensure the Kubernetes manifest (`deployment-k8s.yaml`) includes the correct Slack webhook URL in secrete as base64 encrypted:
   
     ```yaml
     env:
       - name: SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
         valueFrom:
           secretKeyRef:
             name: alert-manager-secrets
             key: slack_webhook_url
     ```

   - **Prometheus URL:** Update the Prometheus URL in the same manifest:

     ```yaml
     env:
       - name: PROMETHEUS_URL
         value: "http://prometheus-server:9090"  # Replace with your Prometheus server URL
     ```

7. **Deploy to Kubernetes:**

   - Deploy using the provided Kubernetes manifest:

     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f deployment-k8s.yaml
     ```

8. **Test the Setup:**

   - Forward the service port to your localhost:

     ```bash
     kubectl port-forward svc/alert-manager 8080:80 -n alert-manager
     ```

   - Send a test alert to the webhook:

     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/alert -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
       "annotations": {
         "description": "Pod customer/customer-rs-transformer-9b75b488c-cpfd7 (rs-transformer) is restarting 2.11 times / 10 minutes.",
         "runbook_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes-monitoring/kubernetes-mixin/tree/master/runbook.md#alert-name-kubepodcrashlooping",
         "summary": "Pod is crash looping."
       },
       "labels": {
         "alertname": "KubePodCrashLooping",
         "cluster": "cluster-main",
         "container": "rs-transformer",
         "endpoint": "http",
         "job": "kube-state-metrics",
         "namespace": "customer",
         "pod": "customer-rs-transformer-9b75b488c-cpfd7",
         "priority": "P0",
         "prometheus": "monitoring/kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus",
         "region": "us-west-1",
         "replica": "0",
         "service": "kube-prometheus-stack-kube-state-metrics",
         "severity": "CRITICAL"
       },
       "startsAt": "2022-03-02T07:31:57.339Z",
       "status": "firing"
     }'
     ```

     Reponse : 
      ```
      {"status":"success"}
      ```

   - Verify that the alert is processed and that a notification is sent to Slack.

### Extending the System

To add new alert handling flows:

1. **Add a New Function:** Extend the enrichment logic by adding a new function in the `alert-manager` module.
2. **Update the Webhook Handler:** Integrate the new function in the webhook handling logic.
3. **Document the Changes:** Update this README and the code documentation to reflect the new handling pipeline.

### Observability

- Implement observability for the alert manager using Prometheus metrics or logs to monitor the health and actions triggered by the system.
